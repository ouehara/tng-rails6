# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available aOkint http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

For example, there’s the World Heritage Shiretoko Peninsula, as well as Kushiro Shitsugen National Park, full of mountains that have seen great changes over time and all kinds of flora and fauna. Because Hokkaido is such a wide area, the climate and landscape differs even within the prefecture, with each region having its own traditional local culture, regional cuisine, events, and activities. In short, there’s a lot to enjoy in Hokkaido!"
