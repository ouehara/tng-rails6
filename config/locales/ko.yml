 # Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available aOkint http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      teaser_desc_html: "일본 정부는 신종 코로나 감염 대책으로 '3가지 밀(密)'을 피하도록 권장하고 있습니다.
      '3가지 밀(密)'이란 '밀폐', '밀집', '밀접'으로 환기가 잘되지 않는 '밀폐 공간', 많은 사람들이 모이는 '밀집 장소', 가까이에서 이야기를 하는 '밀접 장소', 이 세 가지가 발생하지 않도록 하고 있습니다.
      이러한 주의 환기를 바탕으로, 일본의 각 사업자가 코로나 감염 방지를 위한 '안심/안전 대책'을 구체적으로 어떻게 시행하고 있는지 자세히 소개합니다."

        transport: "전 세계의 관광객을 맞이하는 공항과 이동 시 발이 되는 전철, 버스 등의 대중교통 기관은 많은 사람들이 이용하기 때문에 바이러스 확산의 경로가 될 수 있습니다. 여기에서는 공항과 대중교통 기관에서 시행 중인 코로나 바이러스의 감염 방지를 위한 안심, 안전 대책을 소개합니다."
        accommodate: "관광지 방문, 맛있는 음식 등 여행의 즐거움은 많이 있지만, 어떤 호텔이나 숙소에 머무는가도 여행의 중요한 포인트입니다.
        여행의 피로를 풀고 휴식을 취하는 장소이기 때문에 더더욱 안심하고 쉬고 싶을 것입니다.
        여기에서는 각 숙박 시설에서 실시하고 있는 코로나 감염 방지를 위한 안심/안전 대책을 소개합니다."
        restaurant: "여행의 묘미는 '음식'이라고 생각하는 분도 많을 것입니다.
        그 지역의 식문화를 즐기면서 가족, 지인과 다 같이 즐기는 식사 시간은 여행의 즐거움입니다만, 감염 리스크가 높은 접촉, 비말 요소는 걱정되는 부분입니다.
        각 음식점의 코로나 바이러스 감염 방지 대책을 체크하여 안심하고 식사를 즐겨보세요!"
        shops: "그 지역만의 기념품과 잡화를 사는 것은 여행지에서의 빠뜨릴 수 없는 즐거움의 한가지. 많은 사람이 모이는 쇼핑 명소의 소독 실시와 환기 등, 안심/안전 대책을 각 시설 별로 소개합니다."
        sightseeing: "테마파크와 미술관, 박물관, 절, 성 등, 일본 문화와 역사를 보고 감상하는 관광객이 많습니다. 하지만 이런 시설은 일본인은 물론 많은 사람들이 모여서 밀집 상태가 되기 때문에 불안을 느낄 것입니다.
        여기에서는 밀집이 예상되는 각 관광 명소의 코로나 바이러스 감염 방지를 위한 안심/안전 대책을 소개합니다."
        other: "일본에 오면 일본 문화를 체험해보고 싶은 분들도 많을 것입니다. 일본에서만 가능한 액티비티를 안심하고 체험할 수 있도록 액티비티 시의 안심/안전 대책을 체크해보세요.
        또 일본 여행 중에 발생할 수 있는 다양한 상황과 그에 따른 코로나 감염 방지 대책도 소개합니다."
